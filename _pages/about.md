I am PhD candidate in Quantitative Marketing at London Business School.

My dissertation focuses on digital platforms and online advertising. In my research, I combine elements of field experiments, causal inference, and machine learning.

In my job market paper, I study the effect of platform endorsement on user search and purchase behavior, in the context of a large scale field experiment on an online labour market.
