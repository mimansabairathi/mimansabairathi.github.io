I am Assistant Professor of Marketing at UCL School of Management.

My research focuses on digital platforms and online advertising. In my research, I combine elements of field experiments, causal inference, and machine learning to understand the impact of marketing interventions on consumer behavior and firm revenues. I also study the regulatory implications of marketing interventions. For my research, I have collaborated with firms including one of the world’s leading online freelance platforms and one of Europe’s major advertising demand-side platforms (DSP). 

I received my Ph.D. in Quantitative Marketing from London Business School.

Before my Ph.D., I worked at Flipkart (India'a largest online retailer at the time) and ZS Associates (Consulting).
