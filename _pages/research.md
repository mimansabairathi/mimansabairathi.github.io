## Working Papers

**"The Value of Platform Endorsement,"** with Xu Zhang and Anja Lambrecht  
Under review at *Marketing Science (Job Market paper)*

> Many digital platforms with large product assortments endorse a select group of items to facilitate user choice. Popular examples of such platform endorsement are Amazon’s Choice and Airbnb’s Superhost. While it is intuitive that endorsed items may enjoy considerable benefits from increased sales, little is known about the effect of platform endorsement on unendorsed items and on the platform. Using data from a field experiment conducted on an online freelance platform, we examine the effect of platform endorsement on user search and purchase behavior. We find that platform endorsement leads to an increase in search, as measured by the number of impressions and clicks, and purchases on the platform. Surprisingly, this increase is driven by an increase in search and purchases for not only endorsed services, but also unendorsed services. We find that this increase in search and purchases is mainly driven by an increase in the overall quality perception of the services offered on the platform. We further explore heterogeneity in the effect of platform endorsement and find that the effect of platform endorsement on purchase is more pronounced for users with a higher propensity to purchase. We discuss implications for platforms, merchants, and regulators.

**"Influencer Marketing: Content Attributes and Consumer Engagement,"** with Anja Lambrecht  
*(Manuscript available on request)*

> The recent growth of influencer marketing industry means brands are more likely to contract with influencers to produce sponsored content. However, there is little empirical evidence regarding how consumers perceive sponsored influencer content relative to organic content. In this paper, we examine whether consumers engage less with sponsored content relative to organic content. Given the popularity of influencer marketing with brands, we also explore what characterizes successful influencer content. To examine these questions, we use a dataset collected on content created by 510 Instagram influencers operating in United States. We distinguish between sponsored and organic posts using advertising disclosure in posts and supervised learning. To account for endogeneity in advertising, we leverage the timing of regulatory actions by FTC and category-specific advertising trends as instrumental variables. We find that consumers engage less with sponsored content relative to organic content.
To examine what attenuates the negative effect of advertising on likes, we rely on previous theory in consumer psychology. We propose that authenticity of content attenuates the negative effect of advertising on likes. We measure authenticity as the congruence of a post with other content shared by the influencer, the influencer's propensity to share brand-related content, the number of times a brand is mentioned in the post, and advertising disclosure. We estimate congruence of a post using LDA topic model. Our results demonstrate that authenticity of content attenuates the negative effect of advertising on likes. 
Our findings are relevant for regulators who are concerned about lack of advertising disclosure in influencer marketing. We find that consumers view sponsored content less favorably compared to organic content, justifying regulations that mandate brands and influencers disclose commercial content. Our findings can also inform influencers and advertisers on their content creation strategies and suggest that advertisers should provide influencers independence in creating sponsored content so as to maintain authenticity. Finally, our findings are reassuring for influencers who worry that stringent disclosure regulations result in lower engagement.

**"Attracting the Marginal: Online Advertising and Usage,"** with Anja Lambrecht

> Research has shown that online advertising is effective in attracting new consumers. However, it is less clear if the consumers who adopt a product due to online advertising have a different propensity to use the advertised product compared to consumers who adopt the product but have not viewed an online ad. We use data from a field experiment conducted for the advertising campaign of a major media company’s video streaming app to answer this question. In the experiment, consumers in the treatment group were exposed to online advertising for the video streaming app, while consumers in the control group were not exposed to online advertising for this app. 
We confirm findings from previous research that online advertising is indeed effective in increasing product adoption such that consumers exposed to online advertising are significantly more likely to install the advertised app. However, our data suggest that online advertising is not effective in increasing usage of the app, measured as the number of sessions. On the contrary, we find that conditional on installation, consumers in the treatment group use the app significantly fewer times compared to consumers in the control group. Moreover, we find directional evidence that conditional on installation, consumers exposed to online advertising are less likely to subscribe to the video streaming service relative to consumers not exposed to online advertising. This suggests that online advertising attracts marginal consumers who have a lower preference for the advertised app compared to consumers who voluntarily adopt the product and hence are likely to use the advertised product less. Our findings are relevant to advertisers because they shed light on the limits of online advertising in acquiring profitable consumers.


**"Gender Bias in Reputation Inflation: Evidence from an Online Labour Market,"** with Anja Lambrecht and Xu Zhang

> This paper investigates systematic differences in online ratings based on gender in the context of an online labour market. Ratings are a popular information provision tool in digital markets and have a direct effect on sales. We leverage a unique dataset from an online labour market that elicits private ratings from buyers in addition to public ratings after completion of a job. To acquire more truthful evaluations and being aware of the possibility of reputation inflation in public ratings, the platform elicits private ratings for internal evaluation of services. Similar to ratings on other platforms, public ratings are consumer evaluations that are visible to other consumers and freelancers on the platform. We find that conditional on having the same private rating, female freelancers get lower public ratings compared to male freelancers. Our results also confirm the incidence of reputation inflation on digital platforms such that public ratings are higher than private ratings. Hence, our results demonstrate that reputation inflation is more pronounced for male freelancers relative to females. These results are important for platforms and merchants because systematic differences in consumer evaluation based on gender can lead to undesirable consequences for platform participants.
