## Working Papers

**"The Value of Platform Endorsement,"** with Xu Zhang and Anja Lambrecht  
*(Job Market paper)*

> Many digital platforms with large product assortments have begun to endorse a selected group of items to facilitate user choice. While it is intuitive that endorsed items may enjoy considerable benefits from increased sales, little is known about the effect of such platform endorsement on unendorsed items and the impact on the platform. Using data from a field experiment conducted on an online freelance platform, we examine the effect of platform endorsement on user search and purchase behavior. We find that platform endorsement leads to an increase in search and purchase not only for endorsed services but also for unendorsed services. We find that this increase in search and purchase is mainly driven by an increase in overall quality perception of the services offered on the platform and less likely driven by attention effect or novelty of the endorsement. We further explore the heterogeneity in the effect of platform endorsement and find that the effect of platform endorsement on purchase is more pronounced for users with a higher propensity to purchase. Our results have implications for platforms on the effectiveness of platform endorsement and for regulators on the fairness concern around platform endorsement.

**"Influencer Marketing: Content Attributes and Consumer Engagement,"** with Anja Lambrecht  
*(Manuscript available on request)*

> The recent growth of influencer marketing industry means brands are becoming more likely to contract with influencers. However, there is little empirical evidence regarding consumer engagement with such sponsored content relative to organic content. We collect a dataset on the content created by 510 Instagram influencers operating across ten categories. We identify sponsored posts in the dataset using advertising disclosure and supervised learning. Leveraging timing of regulatory actions and industry-level advertising trends as instrumental variables, we causally identify consumer engagement, measured by the number of likes, with sponsored content relative to organic content. We find that consumers engage less with sponsored content relative to organic content. We then examine what characterizes successful influencer content. We rely on previous theory in consumer psychology and argue authenticity of content attenuates the negative effect of advertising on likes. We measure authenticity as -- congruence of a post with other content shared by the influencer, influencer's propensity to share brand related content, the number of times a brand is mentioned in the post, and advertising disclosure. We measure congruence of a post with other posts shared by an influencer using LDA topic modeling. We find that authenticity of content attenuates the negative effect of advertising on likes. Our findings are relevant for regulators who are concerned about lack of advertising disclosure in influencer marketing and can also inform influencers and advertisers on their content creation strategies.

## Work in progress

**"Attracting the Marginal: Online Advertising and Usage,"** with Anja Lambrecht

> Research has shown that online advertising is effective in attracting new consumers. However, there is little insight regarding the type of consumers advertising attracts. Using data from a field experiment conducted for a video streaming app, we examine whether consumers attracted through online advertising differ from consumers who adopt the product organically. In the experiment, consumers in the treatment group were exposed to online advertising for the video streaming app, while consumers in the control group were not exposed to online advertising for this app. Consistent with previous research, we find that consumers exposed to online advertising are significantly more likely to install the advertised app. This implies that online advertising is effective in increasing product adoption. However, our data suggests that online advertising is not effective in increasing usage of the app, as measured by the number of sessions. On the contrary, we find that conditional on installation, consumers in the treatment group are likely to use the app significantly fewer times compared to consumers in the control group. We also find directional evidence that consumers exposed to online advertising are less likely to subscribe the video streaming service relative to consumers who were not exposed to online advertising. We propose that online advertising attracts marginal consumers. Such consumers have a lower preference for the product as compared to consumers who voluntarily adopt the product and hence are likely to use the advertised product less. Our findings are relevant for advertisers and suggest that advertisers should evaluate the decision to advertise based on the goals of advertising campaign.
