Abstract: The recent growth of influencer marketing industry means brands are becoming more likely to contract with influencers. However, there is little empirical evidence regarding consumer engagement with such sponsored content relative to organic content. We collect a dataset on the content created by 510 Instagram influencers operating across different categories. We use advertising disclosure and supervised learning to identify sponsored posts in the dataset. Leveraging regulatory actions and industry-level advertising trends as instrumental variables, we causally identify consumer engagement, measured by likes, with sponsored content relative to organic content. We find that consumers engage less with sponsored content relative to organic content. <br />
<br />
We then examine what characterizes successful influencer content. We rely on previous theory in consumer psychology and argue authenticity of content attenuates the negative effect of advertising on likes. We measure authenticity as congruence of a post with other content shared by the influencer using LDA topic model, influencers propensity to share brand related content, the number of times a brand is mentioned in the post, and advertising disclosure. We find that authenticity of content attenuates the negative effect of advertising on likes. Our findings are relevant for policymakers who are concerned about lack of advertising disclosure in influencer marketing. Our findings can also inform influencers and advertisers on their content creation strategies.'
