excerpt: 'Abstract: Many digital platforms with large product assortments have begun to endorse a selected group of items to facilitate user choice. While it is intuitive that endorsed items may enjoy considerable benefits from increased sales, little is known about the effect of such platform endorsement on unendorsed items and the impact on the platform. Using data from a field experiment conducted on an online freelance platform, we examine the effect of platform endorsement on user search and purchase behavior. We find that platform endorsement leads to an increase in search and purchase not only for endorsed services but also for unendorsed services. We find that this increase in search and purchase is mainly driven by an increase in overall quality perception of the services offered on the platform and less likely driven by attention effect or novelty of the endorsement. We further explore the heterogeneity in the effect of platform endorsement and find that the effect of platform endorsement on purchase is more pronounced for users with a higher propensity to purchase. Our results have implications for platforms on the effectiveness of platform endorsement and for regulators on the fairness concern around platform endorsement.'
